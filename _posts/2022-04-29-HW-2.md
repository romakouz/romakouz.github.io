In this blog post, I'm going to be making a super useful web scraper using scrapy. We will be scraping the IMDB website to find movies and TV shows starring actors from our favorite film/TV shows. In my case, I chose Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Here's a link to my project repository: https://github.com/romakouz/web_scraping ({% https://github.com/romakouz/web_scraping 2020-04-29-HW-2 %})

## Here's how we set up the project:
First, locate the imdb page of your favorite movie or TV show. It should look something like this:
```https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/```
