title:  "Fake News Classification with Tensorflow"

In this blog post, we will be developing a text classifier using TensorFlow that can detect misinformative news articles. We will be using a dataset from kaggle containing the titles and complete text from labeled 'fake' and 'not fake' news articles.

## Step 1: Acquire our training data from the dataset.
Our test and training data have already been seperated and stored into urls, feel free to copy this snippet to load the data:
```python
train_url = "https://github.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16b/blob/master/datasets/fake_news_train.csv?raw=true"
```
Next, we will import the relevant packages:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```
Let's read in the dataset and inspect our data.
```python
train_df = pd.read_csv(train_url)
print(train_df.shape)
```
```
(22449, 4)
```
```python
train_df.head()
```

Notice that the '''title''' column contains the title of each article, and the "text" column contains the complete text.
